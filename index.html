      <h1>Hello! I'm Jude.</h1>
      <h2>I am currently a second-year student at Penn State University studying Computer Science.</h2> <br>
      <h2>Like many other fellow college students, I take part of different clubs and other activities on campus, and I have some hobbies outside of school as well!</h2>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! Once again, I am a sophomore computer science major at Penn State. I came from a smallish high school with about 600 people total, so when I first arrived at college, I was in awe of the sheer size and atmosphere. The college life felt 
        so daunting since I had to be more independent and make myself seen on a vast campus. </p> <br>
      <p>But once I got to know more people and join more extracurriculars, I was able to feel right at home. I joined the Penn State Filipino Associate (PSFA) my freshman year, which was one of the best decisions I could have made. Not only was I able to keep in touch
        with my culture more, but I was also able to make many lasting friendships with other people who were also like me. I was also able to expand on my programming knowledge as well by becoming a member of the Association for Computing Machinery. I even landed an executive position
        where I taught members of the club web development! And finally, I am also in an organization that supports THON, the 46 hour marathon and fundraiser for pediatric cancer. I hope to have many more positive memories and experiences at Penn State!

        <h2>Programming</h2> <br>
        <p>I have always had experience with coding. From middle school, I learned Java and used it to create a Minecraft mod and later an Android app for a GPA calculator. I also became proficient in Python as well as some front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript later on as well!

        <h2>Exercise</h2> <br>
        <p>Exercise is something that is very important to me. In high school, I ran track and played soccer, and now in college, I've had fun playing tennis and volleyball. I also like to go to the gym as well, working out six days a week if possible.

        <h2>Music</h2> <br>
        <p>I also like to play instruments as well! I've been a piano player since I was ten, and more recently I have been learning songs on the guitar. I would like to give special mention to my interest in hip hop dance choreography as well. Learning new moves to impress others is something I strive for.
